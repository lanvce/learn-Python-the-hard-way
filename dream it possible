I will run,I wil climb,I will soar
I 'm underedefeated
jumping out of my skin,pull the chord
 Yeah ,I believe it
 The past ,is evething we were don't make us who we Are
 so i'll dream,until i make it real and all i see is stars
 its not until you fall that you fly
 whrn you dreams come alive you're unstoppable
 take a shoot ,chase the sun find the beautiful
 we will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
 and we'll dream it possible
  i will chase i will reach   i will fly
  until  i'm breaking ,until i'm breaking
  out of my cage like a bird in the night
  I know i'm changing i Know i'm changing
